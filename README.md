# GraphAlgorithms

Advanced Data Structures in Java, University of California San Diego

This project has following implementations, 

1. An abstract graph representation
2. Graph representation using Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List
3. Representating real world 'Road Maps' using java, takes into consideration on how to represent node and connection between them
4. Implementation of BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm to find a path between any two given intersections
5. Implementation of Dijstra's Shortest Path algorithm to find shortest distance between any two given intersections
6. Implementation of A* to find shortest path between any two given intersections, more efficiently
